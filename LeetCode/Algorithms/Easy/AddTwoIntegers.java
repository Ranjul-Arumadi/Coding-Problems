    Given two integers num1 and num2, return the sum of the two integers.
 

    Example 1:

    Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
    Output: 17
    Explanation: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.

class Solution {
    public int sum(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1+num2;
    }
}
